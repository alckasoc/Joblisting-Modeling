ABOUT RAPP

Our purpose

We are the agency absolutely, utterly, fiercely focused on the individual. We use our data, technology and creative smarts to make meaningful, connections with every single person a brand knows.

As a guiding ethos, RAPP stands up for Individuality. So much as, that's in our agency value proposition. We're committed to racial justice, equality, representation, and unbiased economic opportunity, because we know that the strength of our diversity helps us create our best work. And we believe in harnessing the strength of all our Fiercely Individual people, and the differences among us, because that's the surest way to positively impact our business and network culture.



We are a member of Omnicom's Precision Marketing Group (OPMG) focused on digital and CRM marketing.



If we learned anything this year, it's that our organization truly can implement a ""work where you work best"" philosophy. We still have physical offices, and, if they're open, you are welcome to use them whenever you like. RAPP is located right near Chinatown in the financial district of San Francisco, we're used to trollies (and tourists) daily.

No pressure, though - if you aren't comfortable with coming in while COVID-19 plays out, you can still work where you work best. That said, while we do have our ""work where you work best"" philosophy, we legally have to care about what state you claim permanent residency in (it's a tax thing).



From opening a checking account, helping to reduce peanut allergies, or diving into the creative tools that help engineers most, we provide smart solutions for Wells Fargo, Aimmune Therapeutics and Palo Alto Networks.



You have 2-3 years of experience in a data science or data engineering role. A master's degree is preferred but not required. You have a strong knowledge of R/Python programming and database technologies like SQL/Redshift and ideally have some exposure to tools like Apache Spark and AWS Sagemaker.

We are thinking a lot about media mix modelling and multi-touch attribution these days but any experience you have integrating disparate data sets and applying machine learning algorithms to surface insights around consumer behavior or to create more precise and personalized marketing campaigns will get our attention.

What else? Maybe you're a movie aficionado. Or maybe you have an impressively large vinyl collection? We'd love to know what makes you, you."

ML at Picnic

Machine learning is at the heart of our work. While the healthcare industry is waiting for standards and APIs to take hold, we're able to create meaningful medical data today through our process for extracting and structuring medical information from records in whatever format they exist in the real world. We ingest medical records (faxes, scans, etc of printouts from EHRs, electronic data from EHRs) and convert them into structured, labeled medical data. Think of what we do as a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop machine learning system.

Ultimately, structuring data is just the starting point. We'll use machine learning to pull insights from medical data and surface the most relevant information to make better decisions around care.

Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act.

Sisu leverages the massive amounts of data available within private, first-party data warehouses, which capture a real-time, structured view of organizational behavior. By monitoring the performance of key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn, and their relationships to interactions between key factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels, we can help users make better decisions.

Sisu leverages the massive amounts of data available within private, first-party data warehouses, which capture a real-time, structured view of organizational behavior. By monitoring the performance of key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn, and their relationships to interactions between key factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels, we can help users make better decisions.

About The Role:
Do you want to help define what data means at Notion? We are looking to hire engineers with a vision for what our data tooling and infrastructure should look like as we scale, and then to build and operate those systems over time.

You'll partner with teams all around the company to empower every function with data and insights. You'll help evolve Notion and the infrastructure it uses to make sure that decisions can always be driven by high quality data.


You'll design and set up the foundations that enable everyone in the company - data scientists, finance, customer success, etc. - to effectively leverage data. This can involve data pipelines, model serving, dashboards, and many other things!

You'll articulate best practices around logging and ingestion frameworks and implement the changes to make those practices a reality.

You'll implement monitoring and alerting and systems to guarantee data quality and consistency.

You'll determine the best ways to handle Notion's unique data model and usage patterns to derive insights and bring intelligence to product features like search and discovery.

You'll create tools to enable the data science team to produce insights quickly, and help them apply and generalize statistical and econometric models efficiently across large datasets.


For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You have worked cross-functionally to establish the right overarching data architecture for a company's needs, to build data pipelines, and to provide guidance on best data practices for the business.

You have managed data pipelines (e.g. Spark, Flink), data lakes or warehouses (e.g. Snowflake, Hive), authored queries (SQL), used workflow management (e.g. Airflow, Luigi), and have experience maintaining the infra that supports these.

For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.

You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.

You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.

To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.

You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you are explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.


You've built out data infrastructure from, or nearly from, scratch at a fast-growing startup.

You've led or managed a Data Engineering / Platform / Infrastructure Team.

You've owned or managed mission-critical datasets."

About The Role:
Do you want to help define what data means at Notion? We are looking to hire engineers with a vision for what our data tooling and infrastructure should look like as we scale, and then to build and operate those systems over time.

You'll partner with teams all around the company to empower every function with data and insights. You'll help evolve Notion and the infrastructure it uses to make sure that decisions can always be driven by high quality data.


You'll design and set up the foundations that enable everyone in the company - data scientists, finance, customer success, etc. - to effectively leverage data. This can involve data pipelines, model serving, dashboards, and many other things!

You'll articulate best practices around logging and ingestion frameworks and implement the changes to make those practices a reality.

You'll implement monitoring and alerting and systems to guarantee data quality and consistency.

You'll determine the best ways to handle Notion's unique data model and usage patterns to derive insights and bring intelligence to product features like search and discovery.

You'll create tools to enable the data science team to produce insights quickly, and help them apply and generalize statistical and econometric models efficiently across large datasets.


For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You have worked cross-functionally to establish the right overarching data architecture for a company's needs, to build data pipelines, and to provide guidance on best data practices for the business.

You have managed data pipelines (e.g. Spark, Flink), data lakes or warehouses (e.g. Snowflake, Hive), authored queries (SQL), used workflow management (e.g. Airflow, Luigi), and have experience maintaining the infra that supports these.

For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.

You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.

You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.

To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.

You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you are explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.


You've built out data infrastructure from, or nearly from, scratch at a fast-growing startup.

You've led or managed a Data Engineering / Platform / Infrastructure Team.

PicnicHealth is all about making medical records easy to access and using data to power the next frontier of medical research. We work directly with patients to give them the only tool anywhere that truly provides all of their medical records from any doctor or healthcare system in the US—in an easy-to-use, secure online dashboard. Patients can then choose to contribute their unique data to scientific research, which helps researchers accelerate breakthroughs in care for the diseases they care about. To date we've helped tens of thousands of patients, partnered with some of the world's largest biopharma companies, and raised more than $35M including from Felicis Ventures, Amplify Partners, and Y Combinator. Post Series B, we're growing quickly in revenue, partnerships, and people - it's an exciting time to join the PicnicHealth team!

ML at Picnic

Machine learning is at the heart of our work. While the healthcare industry is waiting for standards and APIs to take hold, we're able to create meaningful medical data today through our process for extracting and structuring medical information from records in whatever format they exist in the real world. We ingest medical records (faxes, scans, etc of printouts from EHRs, electronic data from EHRs) and convert them into structured, labeled medical data. Think of what we do as a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop machine learning system. We 1) run OCR to transform the image into text, 2) identify and label regions of the record, and 3) classify medical concepts with codes from standard ontologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, etc) and structure relevant attributes. Ultimately, structuring data is just the starting point. We'll use machine learning to pull insights from medical data and surface the most relevant information to make better decisions around care.

We've sourced and trained a scalable team of nurses in the Philippines to identify and label data and have already labeled records from more than 25,000 different doctors. We're going through a crazy period of 20x growth this year, coming off our recent Grand Prize finish in Google Cloud's Machine Learning Startup Competition .

In traditional banks, back offices are filled with humans. Their job usually is to verify physical documents (like government issued IDs, proof of address, proof of income documents etc), fill out forms, and search for people on google (no joke) and other sites.
Instead of using people, we want to use machines to do these things. Here is our reasoning behind this: If we can automate the back office, then we won't have costs associated with customers like traditional banks. We would be able to offer state of the art finance products to everyone at a low cost, regardless of their bank balance. (Usually banks charge monthly management fees to people with lower bank balance, aka people with lower socioeconomic status - we want to break that cycle).

We 1) run OCR to transform the image into text, 2) identify and label regions of the record, and 3) classify medical concepts with codes from standard ontologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, etc) and structure relevant attributes. Ultimately, structuring data is just the starting point. We'll use machine learning to pull insights from medical data and surface the most relevant information to make better decisions around care.

We've sourced and trained a scalable team of nurses in the Philippines to identify and label data and have already labeled records from more than 25,000 different doctors. We're going through a crazy period of 20x growth this year, coming off our recent Grand Prize finish in Google Cloud's Machine Learning Startup Competition .

L’Oréal, Staples, Mastercard, and other leading innovators use Ironclad to collaborate and negotiate on contracts, accelerate contracting while maintaining compliance, and turn contracts into critical carriers of operational business intelligence. It’s the only platform flexible enough to handle every type of contract workflow, whether a sales agreement, an HR agreement or a complex NDA.

Contracts are the atomic unit of business - everything important that a company does involves a contract: sales, purchases, hires, everything. The process for making a contract happen isn’t that different from the software lifecycle: a cross functional group collaborates on a technical document that essentially needs to be executable - just in a courtroom instead of a computer. Most legal teams are still stuck doing things manually, emailing versions of these documents around seeking approval and revisions with no easy way to automate workflows. Simple questions like “what is blocking this contract?” can be really difficult to answer since the information is locked in someone’s inbox. That’s where Ironclad comes in."

With technology at its core, Metromile is reimagining insurance to make it fairer and actually delightful.

For one project, you might draw on data from in-car sensors, mobile devices, and connected vehicles to improve how quickly we are able to assess driving risk.

Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.
At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

PicnicHealth is all about making medical records easy to access and using data to power the next frontier of medical research. We work directly with patients to give them the only tool anywhere that truly provides all of their medical records from any doctor or healthcare system in the US—in an easy-to-use, secure online dashboard. Patients can then choose to contribute their unique data to scientific research, which helps researchers accelerate breakthroughs in care for the diseases they care about. To date we've helped tens of thousands of patients, partnered with some of the world's largest biopharma companies, and raised more than $35M including from Felicis Ventures, Amplify Partners, and Y Combinator. Post Series B, we're growing quickly in revenue, partnerships, and people - it's an exciting time to join the PicnicHealth team!

ML at Picnic

Machine learning is at the heart of our work. While the healthcare industry is waiting for standards and APIs to take hold, we're able to create meaningful medical data today through our process for extracting and structuring medical information from records in whatever format they exist in the real world. We ingest medical records (faxes, scans, etc of printouts from EHRs, electronic data from EHRs) and convert them into structured, labeled medical data. Think of what we do as a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop machine learning system. We 1) run OCR to transform the image into text, 2) identify and label regions of the record, and 3) classify medical concepts with codes from standard ontologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, etc) and structure relevant attributes. Ultimately, structuring data is just the starting point. We'll use machine learning to pull insights from medical data and surface the most relevant information to make better decisions around care.

We've sourced and trained a scalable team of nurses in the Philippines to identify and label data and have already labeled records from more than 25,000 different doctors. We're going through a crazy period of 20x growth this year, coming off our recent Grand Prize finish in Google Cloud's Machine Learning Startup Competition .

We work directly with patients to give them the only tool anywhere that truly provides all of their medical records from any doctor or healthcare system in the US—in an easy-to-use, secure online dashboard. Patients can then choose to contribute their unique data to scientific research, which helps researchers accelerate breakthroughs in care for the diseases they care about. To date we've helped tens of thousands of patients, partnered with some of the world's largest biopharma companies, and raised more than $35M including from Felicis Ventures, Amplify Partners, and Y Combinator. Post Series B, we're growing quickly in revenue, partnerships, and people - it's an exciting time to join the PicnicHealth team!

ML at Picnic

Machine learning is at the heart of our work. While the healthcare industry is waiting for standards and APIs to take hold, we're able to create meaningful medical data today through our process for extracting and structuring medical information from records in whatever format they exist in the real world. We ingest medical records (faxes, scans, etc of printouts from EHRs, electronic data from EHRs) and convert them into structured, labeled medical data. Think of what we do as a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop machine learning system. We 1) run OCR to transform the image into text, 2) identify and label regions of the record, and 3) classify medical concepts with codes from standard ontologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, etc) and structure relevant attributes. Ultimately, structuring data is just the starting point. We'll use machine learning to pull insights from medical data and surface the most relevant information to make better decisions around care.

We've sourced and trained a scalable team of nurses in the Philippines to identify and label data and have already labeled records from more than 25,000 different doctors. We're going through a crazy period of 20x growth this year, coming off our recent Grand Prize finish in Google Cloud's Machine Learning Startup Competition .

Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act.

Sisu leverages the massive amounts of data available within private, first-party data warehouses, which capture a real-time, structured view of organizational behavior. By monitoring the performance of key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn, and their relationships to interactions between key factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels, we can help users make better decisions. The key problem Sisu solves is to help identify what’s driving change among this enormous feature and hypothesis space.

As a machine learning engineer, you’ll have the opportunity to shape the future of machine learning on massive, structured data. Much like public search engines rely on sophisticated models for ranking and relevance over unstructured text, machine learning is integral to Sisu’s value proposition of ranking and highlighting key drivers behind metrics derived from structured data.

Structuring is just the starting point, and enables us to to build products that improve patient/doctor communication and care decisions, or develop the next generation of data-driven life-sciences studies.

Our Machine Learning team's goal is to continually improve the efficiency of our human-in-the-loop pipeline for structuring medical records. To do this, we have an ambitious plan to substantially increase our ML capabilities. We are looking for Applied ML Scientists to help us succeed with this plan.

PicnicHealth is all about making medical records easy to access and using data to power the next frontier of medical research. We work directly with patients to give them the only tool anywhere that truly provides all of their medical records from any doctor or healthcare system in the US—in an easy-to-use, secure online dashboard. Patients can then choose to contribute their unique data to scientific research, which helps researchers accelerate breakthroughs in care for the diseases they care about. To date we've helped tens of thousands of patients, partnered with some of the world's largest biopharma companies, and raised more than $35M including from Felicis Ventures, Amplify Partners, and Y Combinator. Post Series B, we're growing quickly in revenue, partnerships, and people - it's an exciting time to join the PicnicHealth team!

ML at Picnic

Machine learning is at the heart of our work. While the healthcare industry is waiting for standards and APIs to take hold, we're able to create meaningful medical data today through our process for extracting and structuring medical information from records in whatever format they exist in the real world. We ingest medical records (faxes, scans, etc of printouts from EHRs, electronic data from EHRs) and convert them into structured, labeled medical data. Think of what we do as a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop machine learning system. We 1) run OCR to transform the image into text, 2) identify and label regions of the record, and 3) classify medical concepts with codes from standard ontologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, etc) and structure relevant attributes. Ultimately, structuring data is just the starting point. We'll use machine learning to pull insights from medical data and surface the most relevant information to make better decisions around care.

We've sourced and trained a scalable team of nurses in the Philippines to identify and label data and have already labeled records from more than 25,000 different doctors. We're going through a crazy period of 20x growth this year, coming off our recent Grand Prize finish in Google Cloud's Machine Learning Startup Competition .

"Earli, Inc.",3.2,"Bioinformatics, Statistics and ML Scientist","South San Francisco, CA",142.5,Full-time,1 to 50 employees,company - public,manufacturing,$10 to $25 million (usd),"About Earli

The mission of Earli is large and ambitious: make cancer a benign experience.

Earli is developing a new orthogonal approach for early cancer detection and localization, making the disease actionable a stage when the chances of survival are significantly higher. Rather than rely on naturally shed biomarkers that cancer may or may not provide, Earli's platform technology usurps the dysregulated pathways that cause malignancy and *forces* cancer cells to make a synthetic, non-human biomarker using gene therapy approaches. It's called a Synthetic Biopsy . It can then localize the cancer in a PET scanner, and even be extended to therapeutics. Developed initially by the late Sam Gambhir , former head of Stanford's Canary Center for Early Cancer Detection, and co-founded by serial entrepreneur Cyriac Roeding and gene therapy veteran David Suhy , Earli is funded by Andreessen Horowitz's Bio Fund, Khosla Ventures, Perceptive Advisors, Casdin Capital, Sands Capital, Marc Benioff, Menlo Ventures and ZhenFund. Earli is based in the West Coast's prime biotech hub in South San Francisco. Earli's scientific advisors include Jim Allison (MD Anderson, Nobel Laureate), Pam Sharma (MD Anderson), Bob Langer (MIT, Moderna), Phil Greenberg (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center), Lee Hartwell (formerly Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Nobel Laureate), Alan Ashworth (UCSF) and Judy Garber (Dana-Farber).

In traditional banks, back offices are filled with humans. Their job usually is to verify physical documents (like government issued IDs, proof of address, proof of income documents etc), fill out forms, and search for people on google (no joke) and other sites.
Instead of using people, we want to use machines to do these things. Here is our reasoning behind this: If we can automate the back office, then we won't have costs associated with customers like traditional banks. We would be able to offer state of the art finance products to everyone at a low cost, regardless of their bank balance.

We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers--at no cost.
